    <p>People in Swansea and Cardiff are still breathing air with the most tiny particle pollution in it, according to
      analysis of PM2.5 levels in 2022.</p>
    <p>It also found that the months of March and January had particularly high levels of PM2.5 last year.</p>
    <p>In South Wales PM 2.5 levels are still more than twice as high as the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
      guidelines, although they are within the limits allowed by the UK and Welsh government.</p>
    <p>PM 2.5 is considered dangerous because it gets into the entire body and affects blood and respiratory systems.
      The WHO considers it a carcinogen.</p>
    <p>The worst PM2.5 average reading in south Wales last year was measured in Cardiff, where the hourly average over
      the year was 10.55 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre [AURN].</p>
    <p>In Swansea one location measured an average of 10.37 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre [AURN Swansea roadside].
      But ANOTHER [locally managed] Swansea site recorded an average of 11.27 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre. Other
      areas that are monitored include Port Talbot and Newport and had less than 10micrograms etc.</p>
    <p>The WHO recommend keeping annual PM 2.5 levels at 5 µg/m3 and it say this should be reflected in legislation and
      policy.</p>
    <p>Wales has maintained a 20µg/m3 per year target in line with UK and EU regulations. However, in March last year
      the UK government suggested a new target for 2040, of 10µg/m3, a target that Wales does not yet meet.</p>
    <p>In Cardiff, the annual PM 2.5 particulate matter levels measured every hour were low as 8.52 in 2021 during the
      Covid-19 lockdown.[AURN] Prior to coronavirus pandemic, Cardiff's PM 2.5 levels were 10.09 in 2018 and 11.24 in
      2019.[AURN]</p>
    <p>When analysed by month, South Wales has higher concentrations of PM 2.5 pollution in the spring and winter months
      and lower concentrations in the summer and early autumn.</p>
    <p>While this varies slightly across the region, broadly speaking PM 2.5 levels are highest in March, December and
      January, and lowest in July and September.</p>

    <p>Professor Frank Kelly, who leads an Environmental Research Group at Imperial College London, points to the
      spraying of pesticides and fertilisers as a reason for the increase in fine particulate matter in spring. “At this
      time there is a lot of secondary PM2.5 being generated by action of our continental neighbours like France and the
      Netherlands as farmers are spraying their field with pesticides and fertilizers at this time”.</p>
    <p>He says that these particles "end up as precursors for secondary PM 2.5 which is blown into the UK."</p>
    <p>Although south Wales has cleaner air than the cities of India or China, the WHO warns of a clear link between air
      pollution and deaths caused by circulatory, respiratory and lung cancer deaths. The figures for South Wales remain
      nearly twice as high as the WHO's safe levels.</p>

              PM 2.5 is fine inhalable particle with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, it's hard for us to understand how small 2.5 micrometres is with numbers and symbols.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's imagine a single hair from your hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll start by plucking a strand of hair - you can use your own, or borrow one from a friend with a full
              head of hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The average human hair is about 70 micrometres in diameter.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I take the 1 hair I just plucked and split it back into 30 strands, I can estimate 1 PM 2.5 particle.
            </p>
            <p>
              This size is particularly dangerous because such miniscule particles can penetrate human lungs with ease
              and the tiniest particles can even enter the bloodstream.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's imagine one more thing. Please draw a cubic box in your head.
            </p>
            <p>
              People put a single PM 2.5 particle into a cubic metre box that is one metre across, one metre long and
              one metre high, and express it again in numbers and symbols (µg/m3 ).
            </p>
            <p>
              µg/m3 is the symbol we use to measure the concentration of an air pollutant. It is a measure of
              concentration in terms of mass per unit volume.
            </p>
            <p>
              1 µg/m3 means that there is one particle of PM 2.5 in a box of air that is 1 m long, 1 m wide, and 1 m
              high.
            </p>
            <p>
              10 µg/m3 for PM 2.5 means that 10 particles of PM 2.5 size or smaller were measured inside an air box of
              the same size.
            </p>
            <p>
              Particles are likely to enter through the respiratory tract and bloodstream of citizens who enjoy outdoor
              activities or ordinary people who open windows and ventilate indoors.

        <h2>Welsh Government Pushes Back Against Total Ban on Wood Burners</h2><br>
        <p>
          Air quality campaigners have said the Welsh government is missing a golden opportunity to clean up the
          country’s air with a new law that will come into force in September. The Welsh government has just released
          its plans for the new law, but campaigners say targets are needed to lower the levels of Nitrogen Dioxide gas
          (NO2) and of tiny particles (known as PM 2.5) that people breathe in many of the country’s built-up areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the <a href="https://senedd.wales/media/gbhlcgfn/pri-ld15738-em-e.pdf">white paper</a> stating, “The
          strongest body of evidence connecting an air pollutant with mortality and other morbidity effects involves
          fine particulate (PM 2.5),” it allows for up to three years of consultation before setting a five-year target
          for PM 2.5 pollution. It has raised the hackles of groups such as Healthy Air Cymru and the Chartered
          Institute of Environmental Health (CEIH), an accreditation organisation for environmental health
          professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ross Matthewman, Head of Policy and Campaigns for CEIH said in a press release, “The Welsh Government have
          missed a golden opportunity to introduce ambitious, robust environmental protection targets with this
          Bill. There was an opportunity to lay down a marker by introducing robust targets for both PM 2.5 and NO2 in
          line with WHO guidelines.”
        </p>
        <p>
          “Yet what has emerged has been rather underwhelming,” they say.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those sentiments were echoed by Healthy Air Cymru (HAC), an umbrella group of organisations in Wales working
          to improve Welsh air quality. In a consultation reply to the proposed Bill LOWERCASE, Healthy Air Cymru also
          noted that IT did not include any targets for either NO2 or PM 2.5.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wants the act to enshrine the World Health Organisation (WHO) targets. The WHO has rapidly reduced its PM
          2.5 guidelines in recent years, as more research highlights the particle’s danger to public health in any
          concentrations. In 2021, the WHO reduced its recommendation to an annual daily mean of 5 µg/m3.
        </p>
        <p>
          It says that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) can penetrate the lungs and further enter the body through the
          blood stream, affecting all major organs. Exposure to PM 2.5 can cause diseases to cardiovascular and
          respiratory systems provoking, for example, stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wales uses Westminster’s PM 2.5 annual mean HOURLY target of 20 µg/m3, but Asthma + Lung UK Cymru says that
          under current WHO guidance of 5 µg/m3, every care home, school, hospital, and GP in Wales would be in an area
          where PM 2.5 is above the WHO guideline.
        </p>
        <h3>The fractured landscape of air quality monitoring in Wales.</h3>
        <p>
          The government intends to use the local authority air quality measuring infrastructure to measure air quality,
          with no further financial resources to be committed. That monitoring infrastructure is fragmented with Swansea
          and Cardiff measuring a full spectrum of pollutants for example, while Merthyr Tydfil, which is home to
          Britain’s only open-cast coal mine, measures only NO2. The mining company monitors PM 2.5 and PM 10, but this
          data is not publicly available from the Department for Environment in London.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ciaran Donaghy, a policy advisor at CEIH thinks there hasn’t been enough money given to local authorities to
          monitor air quality. In an email he said that “Underpinning much of all of this, is the issue of local
          authority resource capacity and funding, which has faced considerable cuts over a sustained period”.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless local authorities have the money, he says, “any monitoring or enforcement will be hamstrung”.
        </p>
        <h3>Burning coal & wood at home</h3>
        <p>
          Almost a third of Welsh PM 2.5 pollution comes from people burning wood or coal at home and the new law will
          give councils greater ability to fine households in a smoke control area. At present, unauthorised smoke
          emissions from chimneys in a smoke control area is a criminal offence.
        </p>
        <p>
          This requires physical entry to the offending homes which is problematic for local authorities. By making this
          a civil offence, council enforcement officers merely need to stand outside the offending house and witness
          smoke coming from the chimney to issue fines.
        </p>
        <p>
          On paper this is welcome news for the councils, but once again, the Welsh government is delegating both the
          declaration of smoke control areas and enforcement actions to local councils. The white paper makes no
          provision for more funding to assist councils with air quality monitoring or enforcement.
        </p>
        <h3>Wales is Britain’s PM 2.5 hotspot</h3>
        <p>
          A third of PM 2.5 emissions in Wales comes from a category called “Residential, Commercial and Public”
          combustion, the vast majority from burning coal or wood at home. Wales already lags behind the rest of the UK
          IN TERMS OF LIMITING PM 2.5 emissions. Emissions of PM 2.5 in Wales were estimated to be 6,000 tonnes in 2020,
          down 30% since 2005. But Wales still emits nearly twice as much PM 2.5 per head of population as the rest of
          the United Kingdom. With less than 5% of the population, Wales emits 8% of the UK’s PM 2.5 particulate matter.

        <p>
          One solution that would avoid another three years of consultation, reduce PM 2.5 emissions in Wales by almost
          a third, and lessen the burden on local authorities, could simply be an immediate ban on domestic wood and
          coal burners in urban areas of Wales.
          A recent University of Sheffield study showed that even very “efficient” modern wood burners had little impact
          on PM 2.5 levels from houses. Donaghy said CEIH wants greater regulation of domestic wood burners in urban
          areas where there are alternative heat sources, such as gas and electricity.

          When asked about the lengthy consultation period around the setting of air quality targets, the Welsh
          Government in an email response reiterated that they needed evidence, “We need to understand the limits of
          what’s possible and the associated constraints based on robust science and socio-economic analysis.”
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked about an immediate ban on domestic use of solid fuel they said that strategy could increase costs
          for households. “Costs may fall on homeowners and businesses to replace or upgrade their existing appliances
          to ensure compliance”.
        </p>
        <p>
          “In the current cost of living crisis, we felt a mandate such as this would be inappropriate” they said.
        </p>
        <p>
          That seems to contradict the government’s own data from their 2021 consultation <a
            href="https://www.gov.wales/sites/default/files/consultations/2021-01/reducing-emissions-from-domestic-burning-of-solid-fuels.pdf">document</a>
          on reducing emissions
          from domestic burning of solid fuels. It said that percentage of households needing to burn solids for
          heating, had fallen to 1% nationally as of 2018. That rises to 4% in rural areas.
