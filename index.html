    <p>People in Swansea and Cardiff are still breathing air with the most tiny particle pollution in it, according to
      analysis of PM2.5 levels in 2022.</p>
    <p>It also found that the months of March and January had particularly high levels of PM2.5 last year.</p>
    <p>In South Wales PM 2.5 levels are still more than twice as high as the World Health Organization’s (WHO)
      guidelines, although they are within the limits allowed by the UK and Welsh government.</p>
    <p>PM 2.5 is considered dangerous because it gets into the entire body and affects blood and respiratory systems.
      The WHO considers it a carcinogen.</p>
    <p>The worst PM2.5 average reading in south Wales last year was measured in Cardiff, where the hourly average over
      the year was 10.55 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre [AURN].</p>
    <p>In Swansea one location measured an average of 10.37 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre [AURN Swansea roadside].
      But ANOTHER [locally managed] Swansea site recorded an average of 11.27 micrograms of PM2.5 per cubic metre. Other
      areas that are monitored include Port Talbot and Newport and had less than 10micrograms etc.</p>
    <p>The WHO recommend keeping annual PM 2.5 levels at 5 µg/m3 and it say this should be reflected in legislation and
      policy.</p>
    <p>Wales has maintained a 20µg/m3 per year target in line with UK and EU regulations. However, in March last year
      the UK government suggested a new target for 2040, of 10µg/m3, a target that Wales does not yet meet.</p>
    <p>In Cardiff, the annual PM 2.5 particulate matter levels measured every hour were low as 8.52 in 2021 during the
      Covid-19 lockdown.[AURN] Prior to coronavirus pandemic, Cardiff's PM 2.5 levels were 10.09 in 2018 and 11.24 in
      2019.[AURN]</p>
    <p>When analysed by month, South Wales has higher concentrations of PM 2.5 pollution in the spring and winter months
      and lower concentrations in the summer and early autumn.</p>
    <p>While this varies slightly across the region, broadly speaking PM 2.5 levels are highest in March, December and
      January, and lowest in July and September.</p>

    <p>Professor Frank Kelly, who leads an Environmental Research Group at Imperial College London, points to the
      spraying of pesticides and fertilisers as a reason for the increase in fine particulate matter in spring. “At this
      time there is a lot of secondary PM2.5 being generated by action of our continental neighbours like France and the
      Netherlands as farmers are spraying their field with pesticides and fertilizers at this time”.</p>
    <p>He says that these particles "end up as precursors for secondary PM 2.5 which is blown into the UK."</p>
    <p>Although south Wales has cleaner air than the cities of India or China, the WHO warns of a clear link between air
      pollution and deaths caused by circulatory, respiratory and lung cancer deaths. The figures for South Wales remain
      nearly twice as high as the WHO's safe levels.</p>

              PM 2.5 is fine inhalable particle with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller.
            </p>
            <p>
              In fact, it's hard for us to understand how small 2.5 micrometres is with numbers and symbols.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's imagine a single hair from your hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              We'll start by plucking a strand of hair - you can use your own, or borrow one from a friend with a full
              head of hair.
            </p>
            <p>
              The average human hair is about 70 micrometres in diameter.
            </p>
            <p>
              If I take the 1 hair I just plucked and split it back into 30 strands, I can estimate 1 PM 2.5 particle.
            </p>
            <p>
              This size is particularly dangerous because such miniscule particles can penetrate human lungs with ease
              and the tiniest particles can even enter the bloodstream.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's imagine one more thing. Please draw a cubic box in your head.
            </p>
            <p>
              People put a single PM 2.5 particle into a cubic metre box that is one metre across, one metre long and
              one metre high, and express it again in numbers and symbols (µg/m3 ).
            </p>
            <p>
              µg/m3 is the symbol we use to measure the concentration of an air pollutant. It is a measure of
              concentration in terms of mass per unit volume.
            </p>
            <p>
              1 µg/m3 means that there is one particle of PM 2.5 in a box of air that is 1 m long, 1 m wide, and 1 m
              high.
            </p>
            <p>
              10 µg/m3 for PM 2.5 means that 10 particles of PM 2.5 size or smaller were measured inside an air box of
              the same size.
            </p>
            <p>
              Particles are likely to enter through the respiratory tract and bloodstream of citizens who enjoy outdoor
              activities or ordinary people who open windows and ventilate indoors.

        <p>
          Air quality campaigners have said the Welsh government is missing a
          golden opportunity to clean up the country’s air with a new law that
          will come into force in September. The Welsh government has just
          released a white paper on the proposed act, but campaigners say
          specific targets are needed to lower the levels of Nitrogen Dioxide
          gas and of tiny particles (known as PM2.5) that people breathe in many
          of the country’s built-up areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the white paper stating, “The strongest body of evidence
          connecting an air pollutant with mortality and other morbidity effects
          involves fine particulate (PM2.5),” it could be three years of
          “consultation” before setting a five-year target for PM2.5 pollution.
          It is for this reason that the hackles of groups such as Healthy Air
          Cymru and CEIH have been raised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ross Matthewman, Head of Policy, and Campaigns for Chartered Institute
          of Environmental Health (CEIH) said, “The Welsh Government have missed
          a golden opportunity to introduce ambitious, robust environmental
          protection targets with this Bill. There was an opportunity to lay
          down a marker by introducing robust targets for both PM2.5 and NO2 in
          line with WHO guidelines, yet what has emerged has been rather
          underwhelming.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Those sentiments were echoed by Healthy Air Cymru, an umbrella group
          of organisations in Wales working to improve Welsh air quality. In a
          consultation reply to the proposed Bill, HAC also noted that the
          proposed act did not include any specific targets for either NO2 or
          PM2.5. Healthy Air Cymru wants to enshrine the World Health
          Organisation targets into the Act. The WHO has rapidly reduced its
          PM2.5 guidelines in recent years, as more research highlights the
          particles danger to public health in any concentrations. In 2021, the
          WHO reduced its guidance to a daily mean of 5.0 µg/m3.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wales uses Westminster’s PM2.5 annual mean target of 20.0 µg/m3, but
          Asthma + Lung UK Cymru says under that under current WHO guidance at
          5.0 µg/m3, every care home, school, hospital, and GP in Wales would be
          in an area where PM2.5 is above the WHO guideline.
        </p>
        <h3>The fractured landscape of air quality monitoring in Wales.</h3>
        <p>
          The government intends to use the local authority air quality
          measuring infrastructure to measure air quality, with no further
          financial resources to be committed. That monitoring infrastructure is
          fragmented with Swansea and Cardiff measuring a full spectrum of
          pollutants for example, while Merthyr Tydfil, which counts Britain’s
          only open-cast coal mine among its residents, measures only NO2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ciaran Donaghy, a policy advisor at CEIH thinks there hasn’t been
          enough money given to local authorities to monitor air quality.
          “Underpinning much of all of this, is the issue of local authority
          resource capacity and funding, which has faced considerable cuts over
          a sustained period”. Unless local authorities have the money, he says,
          “any monitoring or enforcement will be hamstrung”.
        </p>
        <h3>Burning coal & wood at home</h3>
        <p>
          Almost a third of Wales’ PM2.5 pollution comes from people burning
          wood or coal at home and the new law will give councils’ greater
          abilities to fine houses where smoke is coming from a chimney in a
          smoke control area. At present, unauthorised smoke emissions from
          chimneys in a smoke control area is a criminal offence. This requires
          physical entry to the offending homes which is problematic for local
          authorities. By making this a civil offence, council enforcement
          officers merely need to stand outside the offending house and witness
          smoke coming from the chimney to issue fines. On paper this is welcome
          news (for the councils), but once again, the Welsh government
          delegates both the declaration of smoke control areas and enforcement
          actions to local councils.
        </p>
        <h3>Wales is Britain’s PM2.5 hotspot</h3>
        <p>
          The table below shows that 34.0% of PM 2.5 emissions in Wales come
          from Residential, Commercial and Public combustion, the vast majority
          from residential burning of coal and wood products. Wales already lags
          the rest of the UK with PM2.5 emissions. Emissions of PM2.5 in Wales
          were estimated to be 6,000 tonnes in 2020, a 30% decline since 2005.
          But Wales still emits nearly twice as much PM2.5 per head of
          population, as the rest of the United Kingdom. With just 4.60% of the
          UK population, Wales emits 8.0% of the UK’s total PM2.5 emissions.

        <p>
          Yet another consultation paper from the Welsh Government, from April
          2021, proposed banning the burning of coal and wet wood residentially.
          As the map below highlights the fact that PM2.5 emissions are
          concentrated in the urbanised South and North-western parts of Wales.
          A simpler solution to enduring another three years of “consultation”,
          reducing PM 2.5 emissions in Wales by 30.0% instantly at no cost, and
          reducing the burden on local authorities, could simply be an immediate
          ban of domestic wood and coal burners in urban areas of Wales. A
          recent University of Sheffield study showed that even very “efficient”
          modern wood burners had little impact on elevated PM2.5 levels in
          houses. CEIH’s Donaghy said CEIH advocates for greater regulation of
          domestic wood burners in urban areas where there are alternative heat
          sources, such as gas and electricity.”
